<h3>Website Visitors</h3>

<p>Like most website operators, StandUpForTheNet.org collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.

From time to time, StandUpForTheNet.org may share non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate with organizations and employees of organizations that are members of the coalition, e.g., for example the number of visitors or signups during a particular period.</p>

<p>StandUpForTheNet.org also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for users who sign the petition.
